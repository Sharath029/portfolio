  <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
  <p>Senior Cloud Security and DevSecOps Engineer with 3+ years taking end-to-end ownership of complex, critical initiatives on AWS and Azure. I modernize legacy systems and deliver secure, scalable, audit-ready platforms for internal and customer environments (e.g., Kenvue, Vision Care JNJ). I lead CI/CD and tooling modernization (Jenkins, SonarQube LTA migrations), SOC2 readiness, ISO 27001 compliance, and technical SPOC for customer audits (e.g., Larimer). I ensure zero downtime during deployments and migrations, often as weekend/off-hours SPOC to protect GTM timelines. I drive FinOps (up to 50% cost reduction), Zero Trust, supply chain security (Cosign), and platform reliability with Kubernetes, Terraform, and Prometheus/Grafana. I invest in KT sessions, reusable documentation, and mentoring to improve DevOps maturity.</p>
